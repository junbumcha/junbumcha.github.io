  - title: "Explainable AI for Trustworthy Healthcare System"
    content: "Reliability is crucial in healthcare systems. This project enhances reliability by introducing explainability, which helps clarify the reasoning behind a model's predictions. More specifically, we focus on our medical reports generation model, which generates reports based on medical images. Our aim is to provide a visual representation that highlights the specific areas of the image upon which the generated report relies."

  - title: "Scene Text Recognition"
    # affiliation: NAVER CLOVA, OCR team
    content: "The goal of our team is to create a world-leading OCR engine. My main contribution lies in the development of the scene text recognition engine. By effectively tackling the out-of-distribution problem, our OCR system effectively addresses real-world scenarios. As a result, our model achieves unparalleled performance in Korean, Chinese, and Japanese, which are the primary languages aligned with our business objectives."

# TODO 본 프로젝트는 또한 OCR 모델의 data augmentation 용도로도 사용됨.
  - title: "Handwritten Font Generation"
    # affiliation: NAVER CLOVA, OCR team
    content: "Korean fonts are composed of 11,172 letters, even not including other symbols, which makes creating a new one a labor-intensive and expensive task. This project has revolutionized the process by using deep generative models, specifically generative adversarial networks (GANs), to generate new fonts with almost 0.1% of the effort. This project opens the era of personalized Korean fonts where anyone can have their own font."

  - title: "Handol"
    # affiliation: NHN, Game AI team
    content: "Handol is a project aiming at a superhuman-level go AI for business use. We've successfully reproduced AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero, and AlphaZero, and our system achieved the runner-up place in the world go AI competition. We've also won several matches against professional players, including handicap matches. Using this system, we offered additional services such as AI odds prediction, AI hints, and AI matches on the company's Go game platform. We've also expanded the system to create automated level design for various turn-based games beyond go."

  - title: "Duplicated Image Search"
    content: This project aims to cluster duplicate images within user-uploaded images on a cloud service. Specifically, a duplicate image is defined as any image that has been manipulated in some way, such as applying photo effect filters, adding stickers, resizing, or cropping. We utilized a SIFT-based image correspondence algorithm for image matching and an approximated kNN algorithm for search efficiency.

  - title: "GANs Comparison without Cherry-picking"
    content: "The motivation behind this project is to tackle the issue of overestimation resulting from cherry-picking in generative adversarial networks (GANs). In 2017, GANs were the most trending topic in deep learning, yet the absence of quantitative evaluation metrics led to a proliferation of diverse GAN algorithms. Each algorithm claimed superiority over others based on non-objective qualitative evaluations. To address this, this project offers open-source implementations of various GAN algorithms and provides an unbiased and objective comparison without cherry-picking."
